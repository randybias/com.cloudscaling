title: Stacker Voices&#58; Russell Bryant, Red Hat 
---

Russell Bryant is the PTL (Project Technical Lead) for OpenStack Compute (Nova) and has spent the past two years working on Compute in his role as a Principal Software Engineer for Red Hat. That combination of experience and technical leadership gives Russell a useful perspective on the complexity of running the Nova project and the evolution of OpenStack overall.

At the OpenStack Summit in Portland a few weeks ago, I talked to Russell about the technical challenges he manages in his role as PTL:

  - spinning nova-volume and nova-networking out of OpenStack Compute into OpenStack Block Storage (Cinder) and OpenStack Networking (Quantum) respectively
  - progress toward feature-completeness of nova-networking under OpenStack Networking (Quantum) in Havana
  - the ongoing need for cross-project collaboration
  - shout outs to some of the key folks whoâ€™ve helped drive Nova forward
  - the development of sub-teams in OpenStack Compute interested in similar functionality
  - speeding up the developer feedback loop on performance and scaling issues
  - perspectives on nova-conductor, a traffic control layer above the hypervisor to facilitate communication between compute nodes and to abstract out database operations for security reasons
