title: Randy Bias&#58; An Open Letter to the OpenStack Community
---

Earlier this morning, Randy Bias posted an open letter to the OpenStack community [here]. It presents a case for immediately and deliberately embracing Amazon and the AWS APIs, as well as those of other established public clouds.

In the post, Randy presents an overview of the history of OpenStack's current position, the evolution of the project's governance, an analysis of how Amazon now dominates in public cloud, the "innovation curve" in public cloud, and how OpenStack can dominate in private and hybrid cloud. He also looks at why fears of legal action are ungrounded, and how the entire OpenStack community can win by embracing Amazon and other leading public clouds.
