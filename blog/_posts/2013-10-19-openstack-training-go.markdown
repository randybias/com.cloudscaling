title: OpenStack Training&#58; Go!

The cloud space is overflowing with buzzwords: cloud, agile, devops, shadow IT... it can be exhausting. Beneath all that hype, though, are some powerful technologies – game-changing, even. Based on the trends I see in the industry, I believe OpenStack is one of those game-changers, and that the skills needed to be an OpenStack ninja are skyrocketing in demand.


With that in mind, Cloudscaling decided it would be super cool to offer public training classes, to share the learnings picked up over some battle-hardened years of making OpenStack run in production.


Here’s a rundown of the courses offered this December in San Francisco:


  - <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/services/public-training/">Cloud Computing with OpenStack (12/2 - half-day)</a>
  - <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/services/public-training/">Cloudscaling Bootcamp for OpenStack (12/3 &amp; 12/4 - two-day)</a>
  - <a href="http://cloudscaling.com/services/public-training/">Cloud Storage with OpenStack Swift (12/5 - one-day)</a>


The first, <strong>Cloud Computing with OpenStack</strong>, is geared toward the business and strategy crowd. It covers the industry shift toward cloud computing, value proposition of OpenStack, and formulas to apply to help decide whether it’s right for your organization. If you’re an engineer who’s chomping at the bit to implement OpenStack but are having trouble getting the higher-ups to understand the value in it, then this might just be the direction to send them! ;-)


The other two, the <strong>Bootcamp for OpenStack</strong> and <strong>Cloud Storage with OpenStack Swift</strong>, are targeted at a more hands-on, technical audience: network, systems, and operations engineers, or end-users. These courses dive into the guts of what it takes to deploy and operate an OpenStack cloud. The beginning of the course touches briefly on the purpose, history, and success of OpenStack as a project, but that’s mostly just to set the stage. The bulk of time is spent stepping through each of the components (Keystone, Glance, Neutron, Nova, Cinder, Swift, and Horizon) in detail, covering...

  - What it is
  - How to install it
  - How to configure it (and trade-offs of various options)
  - How to operate it as an end-user
  - Real-world example use-cases and incidents
  - Hands-on lab exercises, to help things stick

The lab exercises are performed in a virtualized environment on your workstation, so everyone can build, hack, and rebuild without worrying about trouncing on anyone else. The courses also give a peek into Cloudscaling’s hosted demo cloud, OCSgo, just to get a better feel for how things operate in a true distributed model.


Neat, huh?


Cloudscaling is already fairly active in knowledge-sharing via [meetups], [conferences], and [blogs]. Most of the time, however, those of us in Engineering and Ops have had our heads down, building clouds with OpenStack and trying to make them bulletproof. We’ve experimented, we’ve iterated, and we’ve learned the hard way what works well and what doesn’t. Now, we’re excited to be able to share even more of those learnings with the community.

Oh and Cloudscaling happily does on-site trainings too, so feel free to [shoot us an email] if you have a group of folks interested. Even if you’re not in the Bay Area, we don’t mind the occasional airplane ride.

We hope to see you in the classroom!
