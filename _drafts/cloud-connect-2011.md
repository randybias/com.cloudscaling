# Cloud Connect 2011

The 4th annual [Cloud Connect](http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/) is next week (March 7-10). It’s become one of the most well-produced events in our industry, and we’re honored to participate. In fact, I consider Cloud Connect to be the thought leadership event for cloud computing. The 2011 event is the most ambitious yet in the diversity of topics and sheer size. Alistair Croll’s team has put together an excellent series of sessions and participants. Three folks from our leadership team are participating in 11 panels and a keynote address this year: 

  * Randy Bias, Co-Founder & CTO
  * Andrew Shafer, Vice President of Engineering
  * Francesco Paola, Vice President Client and Partner Services
Below is a quick lineup of where we’re speaking and when.
