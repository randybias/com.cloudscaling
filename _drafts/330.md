# The Future of Infrastructure Clouds

Despite the hype around cloud computing and 'virtual datacenters', it's clear we need to take a pragmatic view of what the future holds for on-demand infrastructure (aka 'Infrastructure-as-a-Service' or IaaS).  For example, as I've mentioned before, it's just not practical to assume that all server workloads will be virtualized.  What does the future hold then? **Revisiting Cloudcenters** I've previously made the distinction between 'cloudcenters', datacenters-in-the-sky, traditional datacenters, and virtual datacenters.  Please read that first if you haven't already.  The nut is this: cloudcenters are multi-tenant data centers delivered in a self-service fashion: on-demand, pay for what you use, use only what you need. Each customer's cloudcenter can have any combination of elements necessary for their web application or business need.  Elements can be any of: 

  * Private Network or VLAN
  * Dedicated and virtual servers
  * Load balancers, firewalls, and other network devices
  * Anything else you have in a typical datacenter today
You'll notice that this contrasts pretty starkly with the Amazon Web Service approach where you have to bend your application to work with the infrastructure versus making the infrastructure fit the application. The following diagram illustrates my point: [caption id="attachment_211" align="alignnone" width="517" caption="Infrastructure Cloud Computing Architecture (Future)"]![Infrastructure Cloud Computing Architecture \(Future\)](http://neotactics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/infra-future-cloudcenter-1024x614.png)[/caption] **Compute, Storage, and Networking** What's most interesting to me is that there is a lot of innovation happening right now in the second layer from the bottom in the diagram above.  In order to achieve a future that contains cloudcenters or even just virtual datacenters, cloud computing providers are finding ways to make compute, storage, and networking do much more than they have in the past. In the case of compute a lot of the work has been done for us with virtualization, but storage and networking are other matters entirely.  Although there is some work on storage virtualization it's not clear to me that virtualizing storage subsystems is necessarily what is needed to succeed in reaching our shared vision. **Distributed, Pooled, and Virtualized** So what are some of our options?  Firstly, it seems clear that we're moving to a world where, more and more, distributed computing is the norm, not the exception.  Secondly, pooled resources provide exceptional operational cost advantages (i.e. lower 'opex').  Finally, virtualization offers important and obvious advantages in a world where utilization rates are low and workloads light (e.g. servers or 'compute'), but it's benefits are less clear in other cases (e.g. storage). **Distributed Computing** The academic explanation of distributed computing can be a bit off-putting.  It's easiest to understand it in context.  There are usually two ways to approach building a system: centralized or distributed.  By 'system' I mean any kind of computing system. The difference between centralized and distributed systems is one of complexity.  Centralized systems are typically much less complex, but don't scale as well.  They are also usually susceptible to catastrophic disasters.  By comparison, distributed systems are more complex but scale extremely well and the loss of any given component or part means little or no loss of capability.  Distributed systems are resilient, but you pay for this in complexity. An example of a centralized system is probably your corporate mail server.  A distributed system that everyone is familiar with is Google.  Their infrastructure is one very large distributed computer effectively. Obviously distributed systems, servers, and storage are always preferable for these reasons, but the costs to build and maintain such systems are far too much for typical businesses.  The innovation that folks like Amazon, Google, GoGrid, and others are building in this area will eventually trickle down however. **Pooled Resources** foo **Virtualization** foo
