# Clouds Of All Shapes And Sizes: Economies of Scale Revisited

James Hamilton's presentation at Mix 10 illuminated cloud computing economics that few others have direct experience with, but I also believe that his presentation also raises some obvious and interesting questions that haven't been clearly addressed. (If you haven't seen James Hamilton's Mix10 presentation, [go watch it now](http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/EX01). You should probably also check out Randy's [follow up](/blog/cloud-computing/understanding-cloud-datacenter-economies-of-scale), and then watch James talk again...) James starts out by outlining his background and biases, which are quite different than mine. To be consistent, I don't have experience managing services and optimizing datacenters for Amazon. My bias tends to be web application centric and I have mostly worked for start ups. I've also [helped start a company](http://www.puppetlabs.com/) and given some thought to the business side of managing data center assets and cloud services. I also always liked math, but that's [enough about me](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewclayshafer). The first bit of data James presents is a ratio of the price companies pay for network, storage and administration. The claim here is that the 'large cloud scale' companies pay roughly 7X less than the 'medium' sized companies. Randy and [James Urquhart ](http://news.cnet.com/8301-19413_3-20003591-240.html) both touch on this point indirectly, but I would like to see a bit more on how data was gathered and more of the cost curve for different scales. I don't dispute the ratio ([because big ratios are how many things work out ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law)) and it's likely not a linear ramp, but the shape of that curve and how it changes over time has a big impact on what business models emerge as sustainable. The rest of what I want to bring out of James talk is related to the monthly cost of computational infrastructure. (The rest of his talk is all about how we can squeeze cost out of the pie chart, which is presented with exceptional clarity and insight. You did watch his talk already right?) [caption id="attachment_1026" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="I almost hate to point it out, but it's the kind of detail I can't help notice.

I'm sure it's a rounding error, but add up the %s.](http://cloudscaling.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/james-hamilton-pie-chart-300x188.png)[/caption] The last point James makes that I want to bring out here is the added efficiency of aggregate smoothing the utilization then using spot pricing and the force of the market to smooth the load even further. This type of market driven resource shaping is possible well below the scale of Amazon and I would speculate that there are diminished returns to the smoothing effects at some scale based on the fluctuations and differences in pricing/spot pricing ratios between regions on AWS ([scroll down to the spot pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)) and the fact that at the bottom, there are still discrete machines. The benefits of smoothing utilization is clear, but the necessary scale to get the benefit is well below AWS. The thing that I really would like to see is this cost % breakdown for different scales of infrastructure and organizational data breaking down historic computational need over dates and times. If this data was available , I believe it would reveal opportunities to build profitable differentiated services by looking at the total cost of ownership for each element through different scales and levels of efficiency. (In reality, this aggregate data would be hard to get and there is also some strategic advantage for organizations to maintain asymmetric access to their information, but people have pieces of it. For a large enough enterprises collecting this data internally should lead to obvious strategic improvements.) There are also clear differences in building infrastructure to provide specific workloads and building generic computational infrastructure. If a service can provide some specific advantages to organization with special needs at a lower price than they can meet their own needs, there is a business. Another thing this would make more obvious for organizations is what they should buy and what they should build. Of course that will change over time, as what gets built to take advantage of price and efficiency arbitrage, alters the prices and everyones understanding of efficiency. Clouds have changed both already. These points also brings up the notion of 'private' clouds. Large organizations, especially those who have already paid big chunks of the capital expense, can likely see benefits in cost, efficiency and flexibility moving to an application centric IT operations model. In context anyone of the those benefits might be the deciding factor. (If calling that a private cloud is wrong, then I don't want to be right.) To summarize, economies of scale are undeniable in cloud computing, just like most other industries. There are still plenty of interesting problems to solve in how computational, network, storage and even human resources are provided and consumed in the cloud space. Further, the scale of an organizations computing resources might be necessary to get to certain price points on the purchasing side, but that alone does not determine operational efficiency. Finally, to take the position that only the biggest and  most efficient companies should compete in this space is equivalent to arguing that only Wal-mart should be in retail. (I'm not implying James was actually arguing this directly, but the argument has been made by others before.) Few organizations will be able to compete in the cloud space based solely on efficiency and scale, but that doesn't mean there aren't a myriad of profitable businesses that can be built in, on and around providing differentiated cloud services. I believe people like James will continue to increase efficiency and decrease cost in every aspect of the data center. I also believe that work will have cascading effects as much of that understanding can be successfully scaled down. I expect innovation in cloud computing to continue and likely accelerate. I believe the cloud story is still just starting. We're just approaching the end of the beginning.
