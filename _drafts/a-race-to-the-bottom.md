# A Race to the Bottom or Land Grab?

My recent article, entitled 'Cloud Computing is NOT Outsourcing' stirred a certain amount of controversy. Most notably, there is a contingent of folks who feel that folks like VMware and Microsoft are 'doomed' in the public cloud space. Unfortunately, that wasn't really the point of my previous article. The point regarding VMware was simply: VMware has an overwhelming advantage inside the firewall they may be able to translate to an advantage OUTSIDE the firewall. There are really two major opportunities in the cloud computing space: inside the enterprise (aka 'internal clouds') and in the public space (aka 'public clouds').[1]  I'm asserting that there is no fight inside the enterprise.  VMware effectively has it wrapped up as long as they execute.  This doesn't mean VMware can automatically translate it to a 'win' outside the firewall.  However, as I pointed out, there is a whole segment of 'public clouds' that will be focused on larger enterprises.  And these clouds will deliver using VMware technology in the hopes that they will have greater integration opportunities with internal clouds. In this article I'm going to explore the coming public cloud 'war'. A Race to the Bottom? One way to view this coming [1]
