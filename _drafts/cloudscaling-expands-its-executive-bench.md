# Cloud:  Virtual Servers Are Only Table Stakes

Wherever you look today there is a tremendous focus on virtual servers in 'cloud'. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers focus almost exclusively in this arena first and without much thought about what is required to be competitive long term. On-demand virtual servers is just table stakes in the cloud game. It's enough to play the game, but it's not enough to win. Let's take a close look at what the game really is about. Cloud and Cloud Computing 'Cloud' is about a completely new way of delivering and consuming IT services. It's dominated by the service model created by SaaS companies like Salesforce.com: low-friction self-service IT. It's reached a tipping point in our collective consciousness in terms of 'scale' through large web scale businesses like Google and Amazon. 'Cloud' encompasses SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and any other self-service IT capability you can buy today that is low friction and easy to use. 'Cloud computing' is the architectural, technological, and operational methods that allow 'cloud' to be possible. This is the secret sauce that a Google or Amazon have been cooking up for 10+ years that has now become self-evident to everyone else. Beyond the simple scaling capacity of a Google or Amazon is the way that so many of their cloud services are built synergistically. A diagram will help explain. [DIAGRAM] As you can see here there is a clear demarcation between 'cloud services', which are typically consumer facing and 'cloud computing', which supports the delivery of cloud services. Something like Amazon Web Services' RDS (Relational Database Service) isn't the same if you extract Amazon's authentication system, EC2, EBS[1], APIs, S3 and internal management system. Other examples include any Google service, most of which run on top of Google's GoogleFS, MapReduce, and BigTable services, which are never seen by actual Gmail or Search consumers. These horizontal cloud computing technologies enable that self-service IT experience. This *is* the game. Hosting 2.0 vs. Cloud An unseen challenge faced by a number of telcos and hosting providers is their myopic worldview that the game is simply one of providing on-demand virtual servers to their customer. A Hosting 2.0, if you will. Again, this is simply table stakes in an ever expanding and competitive game. Many hoisters and telcos will tell you that they have a variety of services that their customers can consume, but while at first blush this is true, it's simple facade. Service providers
